-the confirmation script does not work properly if no person has signed
 up.  It sees this as a person signing up with no contact info who
 needs a manual reminder.  This can easily be adjusted to warn the 
 contact person that no-one has signed up for that item.  Should this
 perhaps be checked a little more in advance?
xfix confirmation email to include more detail (description of the item 
signed up for)
-Consider adding more info to the confirmation page itself (similar to 
the updates made to the email)
-add ability to remove a helper (not just manually eliminating their 
info) (ADMIN)
